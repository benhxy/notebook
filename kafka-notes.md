# Kafka notes

## Kafka concepts
1. Producer, broker, and consumer
1. Topic
1. Partition
1. Kafka Connect API 
    * Kafka Connect API and associated Connector ecosystem provides an out-of-the-box mechanism to push data into, or pull data from, a variety of databases, data sources, and data sinks.
1. Kafka Streams API
    * Kafka Streams API ships with a simple embedded database, called a state store, built into the API.

## Kafka implementation details
1. How does Kafka manage nodes?
    * Kafka depends on Zookeeper to keep consistent states of nodes.
1. How is a log encoded and stored in Kafka?
1. What files/directories does Kafka uses? How to configure?

## Event-driven design patterns
1. What are the benefits of event sourcing over request/response (direct API call)?
    * Better isolation: Services are decoupled and can change independently.
    * Offline data: A service can still work without the source service online. The event log (source data) can be updated when the source service comes back online.
    * Faster data access: If the event data is copied into consumer services (state transfer), the local data copy can be accessed faster.
1. What are the benefits of request/response over event sourcing?
    * Simplicity: Easy and simple to implement. 
    * Singleton data: Data only has one copy in source system. This is good when syncronicity (data consistency) is important.
    * Centralized control: Can design centralized workflows. Easy to reason about.
1. What's event collaboration? How does it relate to state pattern in design pattern?
    * A workflow is broken down into individual services. Each service listens to the events it cares about, processes the item, and emit new event about the processing result. As a result, the item's entire workflow history is recorded in the event stream, and the current state can be rendered from history or the last event.
    * State pattern also breaks down a large workflow logic into smaller pieces, and each piece only concerns its own processing. In state pattern, the state class handles some subset of state transitions. In event collaboration, each service handles some subset of state transitions.
1. What is the benefit of event collaboration (choreographies)? What is the benefit of centralized workflow (orchestration)?
    * In event collaboration, if youâ€™re implementing a service, you can change the way you work and no other services need to know or care about it. It better suits larger implementations (particularly those that span teams and hence change independently of one another).
    * In orchestration, the whole workflow is written down, in code, in one place. That makes it easy to reason about the system. 
1. What is a bounded context?
    * A bounded context describes a set of closely related components or services that share code and are deployed together. Within the context, we can use a mixture of request/event, which allows reuse of data. Contexts must be decoupled by events only.
1. What are two different types of events?
    * Notifiation: a call for action.
    * Replication: publish data to transfer states.
1. Difference between event-driven application and streaming application?
    * Event-driven apps use a single stream of event to trigger its processing.
    * Streaming apps use one or more input streams, and produce one or more output streams. They can also be stateful, storing the state transferred from the input streams.
1. Stateful streaming vs. stateless streaming.
